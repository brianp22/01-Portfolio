                    <p id="biotext1">Very well, where should I begin? My father was a relentlessly 
                        self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low-grade narcolepsy and 
                        a penchant for buggery. My mother was a fifteen-year-old French waitress 
                        named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would 
                        make outrageous claims, like he invented the question mark. Sometimes he would accuse 
                        chestnuts of being lazy. A sort of general malaise that only the genius possess
                    </p>
                    <p id="biotext2">and the insane lament. My childhood was typical. Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring
                        we'd make meat helmets. If I was insolent, I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with 
                        reeds. Pretty standard, really.
